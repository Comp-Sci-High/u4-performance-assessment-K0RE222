    <h1>Welcome to the Virtual Escape Room</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p>You wake up in a dimly lit room with no memory of how you got here. The air is thick with mystery, and the walls whisper secrets of those who were here before you. A locked door stands before you. Will you uncover the truth and escape?</p>
        <p>The clock is ticking. Your choices matter. Solve the puzzles, face the unknown, and find your way out before it's too late.</p>
